{
  term1: {
    1: [doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4, doc7],
    0: []
  }
}

LEGEND:
1s -> List of documents which contains the term
0s -> List of documents which doesn't contain the term
ALL -> List of all available documents

- term1 & term2 -> Fetch all 1s of term1 and term2 and perform an INTERSECTION on it
- term1 | term2 -> Fetch all 1s of term1 and term2 and perform an UNION on it
- term1 ! term2 -> Fetch all 1s of term1 and term2, perform DIFFERENCE between term2 1s and ALL which will give 0s. Now perform INTERSECTION on term1 1s and term2 0s
                   Alternatively we can store 0s in the data structure to avoid performing DIFFERENCE between term2 1s and ALL

#If query is not properly formatted, searchh engine will do it's best to get matching results
